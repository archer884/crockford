description = """
Provides Crockford 32-bit encoding for identifiers (e.g. u64 values).

There was already another library that did Crockford encoding, but it operated on a slice of 
bytes or something like that, and it was really annoying to use. This one is pretty much a 
translation of an existing C# library that does only "the needful."
